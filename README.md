# VOL-VRChatOSCLeash

**VRChat OSC Leash (VOL)** is a Windows application that allows other players in **VRChat** to "drag" your avatar in a specific direction—typically using a virtual leash.

This project was initially built for fun, but grew into a fully functioning desktop application with a visual interface.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Live visualization of leash direction and position relative to the avatar.
- Counter support that counts the amount of seconds you've been "dragged"
- Configurable movement thresholds.
- Visual feedback UI for OSC data being received and sent.
- Unity prefab support for adding leash functionality to custom avatars.
- Full support for VRChat OSC on Windows.
